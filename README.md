# About Me

Hi there, I'm Jaydan Urwin 👋

I'm a designer, developer, and content creator from Boise, Idaho (yes, Idaho the potato state 🥔). I was born and raised in Idaho so I guess you call me a true spud. I've been doing web design and dev for over 5 years now and started out just by hacking Squarespace templates. But I found pretty quickly that I am too particular and prefer to build it from scratch. I don't just build websites and web apps though. I've really been putting my spare time into learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) as well.

I enjoy sharing what I know on my [YouTube](https://youtube.jaydanurwin.com) channel and my 📝[Blog](/blog).
